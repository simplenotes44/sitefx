<h2>Forex Trading Basics For The Novice Investor</h2>

<h3>What is Forex Trading?</h3>

<p>Forex is an abbreviation for the term Foreign Exchange. It basically refers to the trade of foreign currencies on the open market. In earlier times, the Forex market, also known as FX, was handled by rich and experienced traders but now everyone can access and benefit from it through the internet. Individuals can buy and sell currencies within minutes if they have access to fast internet. To do this, they will also need to set up brokerage accounts up online.</p>

<p>Foreign exchange, while being the largest financial market, is also among the most stable markets worldwide. Daily fluctuation of currency rates in this market is very little. If you were to trade US Dollar for Canadian Dollar, for example, the difference in price would only change by a few cents every day. The FX market is not only a great source of income for expert traders. but it also provides novice investors with many opportunities. However, before venturing into the world of Forex and currency exchange, you should research and understand all the basics of Forex trading.</p>

<h3>The Benefits of Forex Over Other Financial Opportunities</h3>

<p>People who have been associated with Forex trading for a long time now, that demonstrate to you how the development of internet has lead to the rapid growth of the Forex market. Supply and demands in this process can never be manipulated because the market is so big that even powerful traders like the megabank do not possess enough power to make changes to predefined systems in Forex.</p>

<p>Also, Forex trading is open 24 hours each day as FX markets are open at different times throughout the world. This is a great opportunity for investors as their money keep running even when they are asleep or busy doing something else. Forex Traders have the chance to trade from Sunday 5:00 pm (ET) to Friday 4:30 pm. This means that you can trade when you feel convenient and can schedule it accordingly.</p>

<p>Forex trading also allows high level of liquidity and this factor attracts a lot of investors. There are seven major currency pairs that make 90% of the total transactions. These currencies have price stability. It also means that these currencies have smooth trends and high liquidity levels. Low transaction cost allows traders to trade more often. The liquidity generally comes from banks because they offer cash flow to the investors. This huge amount of transaction ensures that there is always someone willing to buy or sell a particular currency.</p>

<h3>Types of Trades on the Forex Market: Spot Market, Forwards and Futures</h3>

<p>There are basically three ways one can trade on the Forex market. The spot market is the largest of these as it is the only “real” asset. Futures were more popular before the development of internet. This was because they were available for and extended span of time.</p>

<p>Novice traders, who are just beginning to learn about Forex trading, should begin trading on the sport market. Currency pairs are bought and sold in spot market according to their current values. Any currency’s value depends on supply and demand. These two factors in turn depend on many other things. For example, the supply and demand of any currency can be affected by interest rates and economic health.</p>

<p>Forwards and futures are types of trading that do not involve trading real currency pairs. These deal with contracts which represent particular currency types. The contracts also mention the previously discussed price per unit and a pre-set future date when the contract will be settled. When individuals agree upon terms personally, forwards are bought and sold. Futures, on the other hand, are traded on public markets. Federal governments generally regulate these. The contracts usually mention things like number of units that are being traded, the settlement dates and price increments. These cannot be altered. Both forwards and futures are binding contracts. This means that they are normally settled for cash on expiration. They can also protect traders from major risks when trading on the Forex market.</p>

<p>Foreign exchange Trading has become the largest financial market in the world. It provides people with opportunity to earn profit and prosper.</p>
